# Lateral Flow Assay Regression Model
This program is designed to work with a handheld reader that measures the saturation values of the control and test lines in lateral flow assays. The model is trained on a dataset that includes known protein concentrations and the corresponding measurements from the readerâ€™s test and control lines. In this dataset, the earlier columns represent the features (the measured values from the reader), while the final column contains the target outcome (the protein concentration). The data is processed using Pandas and NumPy. Ridge regression, a machine learning technique, is then applied to build a predictive model. This model is used to estimate the concentration of a specific protein based on the user's input of their test and control line values from their lateral flow assay.
